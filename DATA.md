These datasets provide the median age seperated by county in Connecticut. Also seperate by sex, Male and Female. The two pieces of data included are date ranges from 2007-2011 & 2011-2015. They are slightly different in all counties so I decided to use that with my selector piece that was mandatory in this project.
