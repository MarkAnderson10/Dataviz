# Dataviz
Data Viz project

I decided to choose a dataset that tied in with Connecticut.
I chose Median age sorted by county and by Male or Female.
I decided to use a bar graph because visually it looked good and compared Male and Female with good visuals.
With the selector button, I chose to use a data set from 2007-2011 and then a dataset from 2011-2015 with switched it up nicely.
